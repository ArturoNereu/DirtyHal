### Dirty Hal 
We released Dirty Hal in 2017 for iOS and Android platforms. Take a look at the release trailer [here](https://youtu.be/99duX3vRU10).

Dirty Hal is no longer available on the mobile stores :( but as a way to preserve the game we've decided to put all the assets and concept art we used on GitHub.

We have added different sections, for a better viewing experience, we recommend cloning the project to your machine.

The game was made with **Unity**.

#### The Development Team:
* Arturo Nereu
* Marvick Núñez
* Diego Núñez
* Brian Cubría
* Rodrigo Medina
* Ángel Sánchez
* Carlos López

For almost everything animated in the game, we used **Spine** and it's Unity runtime, but with the provided sprites you should be able to recreate the animations in any tool.
